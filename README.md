SHIPS - Shell Intrusion Prevention System

SHIPS is a simple Shell-Script, which sniffes your log-files for multiple regex'es
and executes a command to prevent an attack. 

The primary goal of SHIPS is, to provide a tool like "fail2ban" for
embedded platforms like OpenWRT so it will be optimised for busybox's ash.
